# Micro-Manager
[Kyle M. Douglass](http://github.com/kmdouglass)'s Micro-Manager utility scripts and code for automating image acquisition.

## General Information
These files contain various scripts and code that I have found useful while working with Micro-Manager. You may freely use them as you wish.

Some documentation may be found at the [Wiki](https://github.com/kmdouglass/Micro-Manager/wiki).

If you don't know what Micro-Manager is, check out their website: https://micro-manager.org/

## Instructions
The scripts in the [Beanshell Scripts](https://github.com/kmdouglass/Micro-Manager/tree/master/Beanshell%20Scripts) directory are intended to be run from inside Micro-Manager's [ScriptPanel](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Script_Panel_GUI). Directions for use of a specific script are included at the top of each script.

Files inside [Build Environment](https://github.com/kmdouglass/Micro-Manager/tree/master/Build%20Environment/) are primarily C++ projects for custom device adapters, plug-in's, etc. Compiling the code requires setting up a [Micro-Manager build environment](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Building_Micro-Manager_Device_Adapters) on your own system.

## Micro-Manager Versions and Operating System
These scripts were developed for Micro-Manager 1.4.22 and 1.4.23 on 64-bit Windows 7. I provide no guarantee that they will work with other versions of Micro-Manager or on other operating systems.

## Feedback
I welcome feedback of any kind. You may e-mail me at kyle.m.douglass@gmail.com or submit problems to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kmdouglass/Micro-Manager/issues).
